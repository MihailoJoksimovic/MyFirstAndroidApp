# My First Android App

This is my first app being built in Android. What I'm really doing is trying to figure out my way using Android. At this time I really suck at it :)

The end goal is to have a User's Twitter Feed displayed on screen. Right now you'll see just a lot of trash code while I'm trying to get my way around. Let's see how far will I get in my attempt.
